Program counts Pi by Monte-Carlo method using threads
Compiled with -O0, the program is approximately twice faster (OPEN THREADS == 2) then the analog without threads

UN_REP is for number of points for one thread

It`s almost impossible to get the result with higher accuracy due to the non-ideal randomizer
